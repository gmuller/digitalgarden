[Assignment](https://disquiet.com/2023/11/16/disquiet-junto-project-0620-beat-accrual-accrual/)

I struggled more than I expected to with this assignment. I tried out a variety of things but wasn’t feeling any of it. While listening to [@HippiesWearMuzzles](https://llllllll.co/u/hippieswearmuzzles) Euclidean Dub I started thinking about creepy doctors, and couldn’t get the idea out of my head. I wrote a script and put it the track, adding foley elements to give it some atmosphere. I was also reading a lot to the kids and “doing the voices” this weekend so I was already in that kind of mode. This voice stuff is uncharacteristic for me, but I had fun!
