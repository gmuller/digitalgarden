When hiking uphill or on flats late in a race, use the poles contralaterally: when your right foot strikes the ground, so should your left pole. The pole should land inline with your foot, not in front or behind. Depending on speed and incline, it may not be necessary to coordinate each foot strike with a pole strike, but rather plant one pole, take three steps. 

When hiking up steep terrain, use both poles at once, like skiing uphill. Plant both poles and pull yourself through. Use a three count: Plant poles, take three steps. 

When running downhill, use both poles at once to stabilize yourself and soften the impact. Let the poles land in front of you and guide you through your step, like the uphill in reverse. Plant poles, take 3-4 steps.
