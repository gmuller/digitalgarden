Do 2 runs in a day runs to fit your schedule and to provide more stimulus. These sessions should be 30 minutes ([[Train for at least 30 minutes\|Train for at least 30 minutes]]). Do not split your weekly long run into 2 sessions, as this run provides special stimulus that cannot be replaced by two shorter runs.
