## Developing a Training Plan
- [[There is a maximum human energy expenditure\|There is a maximum human energy expenditure]] but you will not come close to it.
- First work up to the [[Weekly Minimum Running Distances\|Weekly Minimum Running Distances]] for your planned race.
- Plan your long run first. Then plan shorter efforts throughout your week. [[Use a 3 to 1 ratio of time between your shortest and longest activity\|Use a 3 to 1 ratio of time between your shortest and longest activity]] to plan your shorter efforts. [[Sprint more often during training to maintain maximal speed\|Sprint more often during training to maintain maximal speed]]

- [[Crosstrain for additional stimulus\|Crosstrain for additional stimulus]]
* Incorporate [[Workouts for Trailrunning\|Workouts for Trailrunning]]

## Testing Protocols
- For Aerobic Threshold testing, use the [[Heart Rate Drift Test\|Heart Rate Drift Test]].

## Food and Fueling

This is an area where I feel weak, mostly because I happily eat whatever appears in front me. As I age, my laissez faire attitude toward food during running works, umm, less well and I have had to start thinking harder about what I eat and drink, and when.

## Specific Training
- Use [[Pursed Lips Breathing\|Pursed Lips Breathing]] for High Altitude situations.
- Make sure you actually know [[How to use Trekking Poles\|How to use Trekking Poles]].

## Strength Training

You can't go wrong with simple [[Bodyweight Workouts\|Bodyweight Workouts]], but should also progress to things like Wendler 5/3/1 and weighted activities. Strength is important for injury prevention and exercising different motor pathways.

I really like [[40 Workouts - Dan John\|40 Workouts - Dan John]]
