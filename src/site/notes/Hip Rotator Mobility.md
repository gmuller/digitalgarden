When one joint can't move freely, the systems upstream and downstream from that joint will be forced to make up the difference. 

Load up you hip with resistance by getting on all fours and driving weight down on to one knee. This will feel like driving the femur out of the back of your glutes. Rotate the leg to create rotation and continue to load the knee and drive that femur back.
