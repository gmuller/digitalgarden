# Antilibrary

Large personal library of many of which have not been read. An ode to what you want to explore. They have more potential value unread rather than read. Buy the books that other author's have referenced. Ask others for recommendations. Ask for [[Antirecommendations\|Antirecommendations]].

According to the writers at [Farnham Street:](https://fs.blog/the-antilibrary/)

>  My library serves as a visual reminder of what I donâ€™t know.

The Anti-library is a check on your own ego, a simple way to look up at the shelves full of unread books and put you back in your place.
