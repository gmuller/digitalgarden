Still raising two kids with my wonderful wife in the metro Atlanta area. They're getting older, and so am I. 
## Running

In year 11 of ultrarunning. For the 6th year in a row I did not get into [WSER](wser.org), so still planning the year. I will probably run:

- Coyote Ugly 50k in March 2024
- Great Southern Endurance Run in May 2024 
- High Lonesome 100 (for the 5th time)
- No Business 100 (for the second time)
- Grindstone?

But... I'm not committed to anything yet. 
## Music

I've found an outlet in [disquiet junto](https://disquiet.com/2012/01/27/the-disquiet-junto/). Resetting this year and getting back to my drums more. 
## Career

Still solving water at Xylem as VP of Platform Strategy and Architecture. 
## [[Books\|Books]]

Planning on a deep dive into Viking and Anglo-saxon culture (thanks to my friend Bobby Johnson). After listening to Dan Carlin's [Twilight of the Aesir](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-69-twilight-of-the-aesir/) I got interested in reading [[The Children of Ash and Elm - Neil Price\|The Children of Ash and Elm - Neil Price]], which Carlin references extensively, but Bobby recommends reading up on a few others in advance. 

In [[2023 Books in Review\|2023]] I read a lot of Robert Anton Wilson, but its time to move on. After my adventures in Anglo-Saxon history I'll be ready for more guerilla ontology.
