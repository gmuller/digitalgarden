Still raising two kids with my wonderful wife in the metro Atlanta area. They're getting older, and so am I. 
## Running

In year 11 of ultrarunning. For the 6th year in a row I did not get into [WSER](wser.org), so still planning the year. I will probably run:

- [SweetH20 - March 2024](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=109964#id712633)
- [Great Southern Endurance Run - May 2024](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=109797#id712633)
- High Lonesome 100 (for the 5th time) - DNF
- [Arkansas Traveller 100](http://www.runarkansas.com/AT100/ATmain.php)
## Music

Mostly fiddling around with the [[Teenage Engineering EP-133\|Teenage Engineering EP-133]]. The kids like to goof off with it on the couch before bed. 
## Career

I joined Irth Solutions this year as SVP of Engineering. 
## [[Books\|Books]]

I've been on a Western binge this year. Read Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy, Blood Meridian, [[Empire of the Summer Moon - S.C. Gwynne\|Empire of the Summer Moon - S.C. Gwynne]]. I'm introducing a little Civil War history with S.C. Gwynne's biography of Stonewall Jackson, *Rebel Yell*.
