# Now

Still raising two kids in the metro Atlanta area. Also this other stuff

## Running

Running a lot. Big race calendar for 2022:

- [[0 Inbox/Cocodona 250|Cocodona 250]]
- [[High Lonesome|High Lonesome]]
- [[UTMB|UTMB]]

## Music

Playing my [[Red Peavey Radial Pro 1000|Red Peavey Radial Pro 1000]] kit when I get a chance, especially this February when Tim and I recorded [[Letter Seventeen|Letter Seventeen]]'s latest album [Falcon Payments](https://letterseventeen.bandcamp.com/album/falcon-payments)

Jamming out with a [[Polyend Tracker|Polyend Tracker]], [[norns|norns]], and [[Novation Circuit Tracks|Novation Circuit Tracks]] when I get a few moments.

## Work

Vice President of Software at Xylem, inc. Focused on changing the way that we build software in the utilities industry. When my kids asked what I did at work all day I tell them "I solved water... and electric".

## Writing

Not enough, looking for time to do more.

## Books

Yeah, lots of [[Books|Books]].
