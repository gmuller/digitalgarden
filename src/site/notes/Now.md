Still raising two kids with my wonderful wife in the metro Atlanta area. They're getting older, and so am I. 
## Running

In year 11 of ultrarunning. For the 6th year in a row I did not get into [WSER](wser.org), so still planning the year. I will probably run:

- SweetH20 in March 2024 - committed 
- Great Southern Endurance Run in May 2024 - committed
- High Lonesome 100 (for the 5th time) - committed
- No Business 100 (for the second time)?
- Grindstone?
## Music

I've found an outlet in [disquiet junto](https://disquiet.com/2012/01/27/the-disquiet-junto/). Resetting this year and getting back to my drums more. Looking for the best snare to record on. 
## Career

Still solving water at Xylem as VP of Platform Strategy and Architecture.
