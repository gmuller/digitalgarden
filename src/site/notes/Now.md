Still raising two kids with my wonderful wife in the metro Atlanta area. They're getting older, and so am I. 
## Running

In year 11 of ultrarunning. For the 6th year in a row I did not get into [WSER](wser.org), so still planning the year. I will probably run:

- [SweetH20 - March 2024](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=109964#id712633)
- [Great Southern Endurance Run - May 2024](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=109797#id712633)
- High Lonesome 100 (for the 5th time) - DNF
- [Arkansas Traveller 100](http://www.runarkansas.com/AT100/ATmain.php)
## Music

I've found an outlet in [disquiet junto](https://disquiet.com/2012/01/27/the-disquiet-junto/). Resetting this year and getting back to my drums more. Looking for the best snare to record on. 
## Career

Still solving water at Xylem as VP of Platform Strategy and Architecture.
