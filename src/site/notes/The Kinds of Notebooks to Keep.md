I keep a few types of notebooks laying around for different purposes

- **Logbook** - This is a bullet journal style "what happened today?" notebook. I keep it with me most of the time as a "reset" to get back on track when I'm doing something unproductive and stupid, but more importantly at night before bed as a way to relive the day. I find that when I review the day and log the events in the book, as if I were writing a Captains Log, time slows down and I can better imprint the memories of the things that happened. If all I did was go to meetings at work, it makes for boring stuff. It forces me to think about how I'm going to put tomorrow to better use. 
- **Pocket notebook** - When I just need something I can stick in my pocket to use if I go for a walk and need to jot something down. If I'm being honest, I am more likely to just use my phone and Apple Notes or Siri to take a quick note for review later. 
- **750** - When I learned about writing out a few quick notes in the morning I learned it as 750 words. I later found this comes from Julia Cameron's Morning Pages exercise in The Artist's Way. I use a large format notebook for this, with smooth pages and a fountain pen. 
- **Dream Journal** - This is a pad I keep right next to the bed on the rare case that I remember a dream. When I do, I jot it down here. More often lately I've used iPad's wakeup on Pen feature so that I can note things in the dark with little to no effort. 
- **Wet book** - This is one of those Rite in the Rain notebooks that I can take by the pool or hot tub, into a sauna, or the shower. I get a lot of random ideas there and almost nothing else is suitable. 

Other possible notebooks that I don't keep but may:

- The Great Work - For the Great Work
- A Real Journal - Diarists are useful only when you can read back on their thoughts decades or centuries in the future. Getting past the contemporary need that I have to write, this produces something for future generations to learn from, if only to learn about sentiment for someone like me in the far future.
