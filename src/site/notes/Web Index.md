This site should feel like a labyrinth. You are meant to get lost in it.

Wander around, clicking on whatever you like, but some places to enter might be [[Music\|Music]] and [[Writing\|Writing]]. You can see what I'm doing [[Now\|Now]], or look at past [[Projects\|Projects]]. You can also reach me on some crumbling social media platforms, like [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/grantmuller/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/glmuller), or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/grantmuller).
