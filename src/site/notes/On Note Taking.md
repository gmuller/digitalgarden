# On Note Taking; Its Methods and Adherents

This is a note about note taking. Its not lost on me how ridiculous that is, but it is still so. Think about Fleeting notes, fleeting thoughts, and the value of capturing them. Think about concepts like Collector's Fallacy and what it means to forget a note as not valuable, just as many thoughts have no value.

## Concepts
- Inversion principle: don’t edit 10 notes to put them in the right category, edit one note to collect 10
- Tags only for immutable things, categories, etc
- Folders and tags are basically equivalent in terms of edits. Sure, a note can be in many “tags” but to put them there you have to edit then all individually. This is the ownership principle in the inversion principle. The notes are nodes, leaves. The branch owns them. Many branches can touch the leaves, but the leaves don’t move from branch to branch, like they would in a folder structure.
- Folder structure: files moving from branch to branch.
- Tag structure: files belonging to many branches
- Link structure: files owning many files
- Think of the notes like source files: you want to edit as few of them as possible to change the structure. The link structure of a “file” acting like a folder and owning the file nodes is the easiest to make changes to.
- Think of the Hollywood principle: don’t call us, well call you. Is this related to Inversion of Control in software
