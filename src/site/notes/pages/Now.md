# Now

Still raising two kids with my wonderful wife in the metro Atlanta area. They're getting older, and so am I. 

## Running

Running, faster but shorter this year:

- Coyote Ugly 50k
- Great Southern Endurance Run
- Going for a fifth and final finish at High Lonesome 100

## Music

Tough to get to this year, mostly sketches and banging around on the drums between meetings.

Jamming out with a [[pages/Polyend Tracker\|Polyend Tracker]], [[pages/Monome Norns\|Monome Norns]], and [[Novation Circuit Tracks\|Novation Circuit Tracks]] on occasion.

## Work

Vice President of Software Platform Strategy and Architecture at Xylem, inc. Focused on changing the way that we build software in the utilities industry. When my kids asked what I did at work all day I tell them "I solved water."

## Writing

Not enough, looking for time to do more.

## Books

Yeah, lots of [[pages/Books\|Books]].
