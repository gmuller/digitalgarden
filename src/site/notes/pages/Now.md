# Now

Still raising two kids with my wonderful wife in the metro Atlanta area.

## Running

Running a lot. Big race calendar for 2022:

- [[Cocodona 250\|Cocodona 250]]
- [[pages/UTMB\|UTMB]]

## Music

Playing my [[pages/Red Peavey Radial Pro 1000\|Red Peavey Radial Pro 1000]] kit when I get a chance, especially this February when Tim and I recorded [[Letter Seventeen\|Letter Seventeen]]'s latest album [Falcon Payments](https://letterseventeen.bandcamp.com/album/falcon-payments)

Jamming out with a [[pages/Polyend Tracker\|Polyend Tracker]], [[pages/Monome Norns\|Monome Norns]], and [[Novation Circuit Tracks\|Novation Circuit Tracks]] on occasion.

## Work

Vice President of Software at Xylem, inc. Focused on changing the way that we build software in the utilities industry. When my kids asked what I did at work all day I tell them "I solved water."

## Writing

Not enough, looking for time to do more.

## Books

Yeah, lots of [[pages/Books\|Books]].
