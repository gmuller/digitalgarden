Often referred to as pressure breathing or Auto PEEP, pursed lips breathing is a technique for breathing easier at altitude. I have some work to do to understand the mechanisms and whether it works at all ([this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871630/) contradicts that it does), but it is attested to in a variety of sources such as [[Shook - Jennifer Hull\|Shook - Jennifer Hull]]

The technique:

1. Inhale through your nose normally, perhaps a 2 count
2. Pucker your lips
3. Exhale slower than you inhaled, 2 or three times longer 

While exercising the rates may be different, but use this technique to improve the ability to perform work at high altitudes.
