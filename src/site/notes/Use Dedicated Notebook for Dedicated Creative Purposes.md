Over the years I've used a variety of notebooks as journals, logbooks, sketch books, morning pages, and other writing purposes. For a long time just using one notebook for everything seemed liked a good idea, right up until the distractions of one area of my life invaded another. I've learned over time that having dedicated notebooks for specific purposes. Its hard enough as it is to remain focused on any one writing endeavor without your work to do list and your record of yesterday's events crowding out your conscious and subconscious mind. The last thing you want to be reminded of during a sketching session is the code you need to write by Monday. 

If you want to establish certain writing rituals, then yo can take advantage of the fact that [[Environment plays a critical role in habit formation\|Environment plays a critical role in habit formation]] by putting notebooks in targeted locations with a specific purpose. This uses the note book as reinforcement for a kind of habit or behavior you want to build rather than for its own sake.
