## 60 Second Hill Repeats
6-10 intervals, moderately hard for 60 seconds, then on each repeat go to the same point, without looking at your watch. Do it once a week.

## Long runs with Strides
Just incorporate 30 second strides on long runs.

## Lunges
40 walking lunges, side lunges and rear lunges. Or barbell lunges. Do some jumping lunges if you can handle it.

## Downhill Strides
8 downhill. Grade can be slight. 

## Super Slow
Way slower than you're running most of the time.
