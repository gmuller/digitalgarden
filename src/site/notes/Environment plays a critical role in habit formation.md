# Environment plays a critical role in habit formation
Clear provides an illustration:

> In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.  

Every habit is initiated by a cue. Craft an environment that will cue you to perform the habit. Don’t rely on discipline, motivation or chance. Create an environment that does not rely on self-control to achieve your habits and goals, so that you don’t have to rely on limited supplies of discipline in order to follow-through on a habit. 

Don’t attempt to perform your new habit in an environment that does not support it, you are far more likely to fail. As James Clear points out:

> If you’re trying to add meditation into your morning routine but mornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.

The simplest way to ensure your environment cues you to perform a habit is to rely on visual cues. Clear points out that:

> The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.  

This might be as simple as placing your book on your pillow, where you will see it, or placing your pills on the counter next to your coffee pot where you will see them. 

Think about how you interact with your environment. This will lead you to “stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects…[but] as filled with relationships”. For insomniacs it is important to avoid the bed and the bedroom for any other reason than sleeping. When you associate your bed with the activity of sleeping, and not with reading the news and planning for tomorrow, you’re less like to be distracted when you hop into bed for a good night’s sleep. The same is true of other activities, such as writing. If you interact with a particular computer *only* to write with, you will only associate that computer and that desk and that keyboard with writing, and will be less likely to fall into distraction and use it for something different. 

Use the “One Space, One Use” mantra as a way of maximizing environment design for your behaviors. Create one space for work. Create one environment for writing music. When you multi-purpose an environment, it becomes too easy to distract yourself with tasks unrelated to the behavior you want to perform. Clear advises: 

> Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.

Consider moving to a new environment when you want to create a new habit. Clear says:

> habits can be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.

Stephen King used this method when he needed to get himself back into writing after getting hit by a van. His wife setup a desk for him in the laundry room, and he started to write in that little room everyday.
