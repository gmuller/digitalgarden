# Antirecommendations

Streaming music services recommend songs to you based on what they believe you like. Netflix recommends movies to you based on your ratings. You ask a friend to recommend a good book based on your love of history.

Antirecommendations are the opposite of all that. An antirecommendation is something you are _expected_ to hate. It's recommending a romance novel to someone who likes technical non-fiction. It's recommending a hefty mathematics tome to an art student. Antirecommendations are the things you're not expected to love, but unexpectedly might. 

Why ask for Antirecommendations? They shake you up.
