A personality test.

You're two steps into your biggest race of the year when a booming voice resounds, "This is the last run of your life. Make it count!"

Do you:

A. **Put the hammer down.** Tear ass through the course in search of one last shot at glory and your physical limits

B. **Slow down to a comfortable, easy run.** Make it last, take in the sights, and chat up your fellow racers
